## AWS Notes

- pick a domain name (the hardest part)
- rent domain name

- link server to domain name
- celebrate creating your website

## CSS Notes

- use flex to set the orientation of the elements
- use bootstrap for header and footer.
- to use bootstrap, you add classes to your elements

## HTML Notes

- make sure to label stuff clearly so that people using a screen reader can still use your website
- if you want the user to be able to input stuff use a form
- you can also make input stuff that is "readonly" and then user won't be able to update it
- use "class" in tags. It makes css easier later on.
