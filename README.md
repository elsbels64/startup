# Higher or Lower Game

[My Notes](notes.md)

This website will be a higher or lower game. Players will guess if the next card is higher or lower than the last and if they guess correctly, they get to keep playing. High scores are shared with other players


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology

### Elevator pitch

This website will be a higher or lower game. Players will guess if the next card is higher or lower than the last and if they guess correctly, they get to keep playing and their score increases. Once the player's game ends the scores are shared with other players

### Design

![Design image](higherOrLowerLoginMockup.png)
![Design image](higerOrLowerGameMockup.png)
Two pages. A login page and a page for playing the game. The login page will have a place for imputting email and password and a button to login. 
The page for the game will have buttons for picking higher or lower and submitting your answer. It will also have a place to display other player's scores. It will also display the previous card and the deck

Here is a sequence diagram of how messages will be sent to other players

    Server-->>Player3: Other players see your scores
    Player3->>Server: Player3 scores points until their game ends
    Server-->>You: You see Player3's score
    Server-->>Player2: Player2 sees Player3's score
    Player2->>Server: Player2 scores points until their game ends
    Server-->>You: You see Player2's score
    Server-->>Player3: Player3 sees Player2's score
```

### Key features

- See other players' scores in realtime
- The ability to switch between higher or lower before you hit the flip button to submit your guess
- Display of current score

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - two pages. a page for logging in and a page for playing the game.
- **CSS** - nice color scheme. button highlighting during play. make it so the website works on different screen sizes.
- **React** - Login. Bottons will update the users choice, flip button, and route between pages.
- **Service** - Endpoints for: logging in, switching between higher and lower, calculating score, and storing/retrieving scores. Third party call to get the next card in the deck
- **DB/Login** - Securely store usernames, passwords, and highscores. Logs in and registers the user. The user can't play unless they are logged in.
- **WebSocket** - Users' scores are sent to other players from the server in realtime.
